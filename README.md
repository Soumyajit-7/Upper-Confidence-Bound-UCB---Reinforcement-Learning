# Upper-Confidence-Bound-UCB---Reinforcement-Learning
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) is a concept commonly used in the context of multi-armed bandit problems, which are a type of reinforcement learning problem. In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment and learns to make decisions (actions) in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.
